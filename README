DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows your controller class to dispatch XMLRPC methods from
    it's own class.

  METHODS
   $c->xmlrpc
    Call this method from a controller action to set it up as a endpoint for
    RPC methods in the same class.

NEW ACTION ATTRIBUTES
    Remote
        The "Remote" attribute indicates that this action can be dispatched
        through RPC mechanisms like XML-RPC
